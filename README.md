# Hello-world
This is a simple repository meant as a way to learn how to use github.
This is my first day learning git. I'm learning this as part of a process of learning front-end programming, which is in itself a first step into becoming a fullstack developer. I'll admit, programming is not as easy as I initially thought it was going to be. Well to be fair, i didn't think programming was going to be easy, but i most definitely thought it would be easier than i am now finding it to be.
